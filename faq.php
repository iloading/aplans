              <p>Terms and Conditions agreements act as a legal contract between you (the company) who has the website or mobile app and the user who access your website and mobile app.
                Having a Terms and Conditions agreement is completely optional. No laws require you to have one. Not even the super-strict and wide-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                It’s up to you to set the rules and guidelines that the user must agree to. You can think of your Terms and Conditions agreement as the legal agreement where you maintain your rights to exclude users from your app in the event that
                they abuse your app, where you maintain your legal rights against potential app abusers, and so on.
                Terms and Conditions are also known as Terms of Service or Terms of Use.</p>

              <p class="m-0">This document, along with any other documents we give you pertaining to your account(s), is a contract that establishes rules, which control your account(s) with us. Please read this carefully. If you sign the signature card or open
                or continue to have your account with us, you agree to these rules. You will receive a separate schedule of rates, qualifying balances, and fees if they are not included in this document. If you have any questions, please call us.
                This agreement is subject to applicable federal laws and the laws of the state of Illinois (except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary such rules or laws). The body of state and federal law that governs our
                relationship with you, however, is too large and complex to be reproduced here. The purpose of this document is to:
                1.summarize some laws that apply to common transactions;
                2.establish rules to cover transactions or events which the law does not regulate;
                3.establish rules for certain transactions or events which the law regulates but permits variation by agreement; and
                4.give you disclosures of some of our policies to which you may be entitled or in which you may be interested.
                If any provision of this document is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. We may permit some variations from our standard agreement, but we must agree to
                any variation in writing either on the signature card for your account or in some other document.
                As used in this document the words 'we,' 'our,' and 'us" mean the financial institution and the words 'you' and 'your' mean the account holder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over the
                funds in the account. The headings in this document are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this document
                should be construed so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.</p>
